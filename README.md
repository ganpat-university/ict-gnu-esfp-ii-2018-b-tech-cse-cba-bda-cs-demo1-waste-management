Hear ons is a parent class and sgn is child class.
All variable is declar in parent class.
And in child class we use set function to set data and get function to get data.
Here in main we run for loop until you enter ‘q’.
Inside loop we give option to user to chose automatic data entry or manual data entry.
If we chose automatic data entry we give option to user to chose data from 7 different file 
file.

									member 3
search house in Maharashtra whose no of family members is less than 3 and suggestions are given.

search house in Maharashtra and Delhi which have wet waste type and quantity is greater than 6 kg.
if(k==7)
{
    for(i=0;i<=10;i++)
    {
        if(ob[i].state==2 || ob[i].state==3 )
        {
            if(ob[i].quantity>6 && ob[i].west==2)
            {
            ob[i].get2();
            }
        }
    }
}        (if we tack k=7 so it if will run.)
Hear if user tack 1 so it will go inside 1st if and then it will go inside for loop and inside for loop we add if condition that check that                   
 ob[i].state ==2
means state that part of ob[0](for 1st running loop in for)  is equal to 
	or not if yes than call get function of ob[0] if not for loop 
	will run until 10 and check .if yes call for that ob[i]’s get 
	function
